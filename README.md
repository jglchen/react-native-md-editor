# React Native Markdown Editor

This is a react native(mobile) version of [React Markdown Editor](https://jglchen.github.io/react-md-editor), a Markdown editor app with **React.js** built to facilitate editing Markdown documents.

Markdown is not a syntax that an average user will be familiar with, nor is it visually clear while editing. In otherwords, for an unfamiliar user, the syntax they write will make little sense until they view the result. This app has been designed to bridge this gap for non-technical users who are less familiar with or just learning Markdown syntax.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through the [Expo Publish Link](https://expo.dev/@jglchen/md-editor) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
